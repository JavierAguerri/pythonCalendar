# pythonCalendar
Python demo - calendar exercise

This is a demo program to showcase my nascent Python skills.

The program prints a menu and prompts the user for an integer value between 1 and 4.

1. Yearly calendar
2. Monthly calendar
3. Which weekday is...?
4. Exit

Option 1 asks the user for a year and prints a calendar for it.
Option 2 asks the user for a month and prints a calendar for it.
Option 3 asks the user for a specific date and prints the week day (Monday, Tuesday, etc.) for it.
Option 4 exits the program.

Considerations:
- All user inputs must be validated.
- The program can take years after 1900 only.
- The program will keep executing until the user inputs option 4.

Example of program output:

  January        2007
  M  T  W  T  F  S  D
